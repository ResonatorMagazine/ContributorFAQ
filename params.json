Think of it like that old riddle about the farmer who has to get a chicken, a fox, a baby, and a knife across a river. GitHub is our boat through which we will ferry all content - and hopefully, no babies will shiv any foxes along the way.  \r\n\r\nTo contribute your articles, media, and playlists to Resonator, you'll have to:\r\n\r\n* Create a GitHub profile\r\n* Download and install the GitHub client on your computer\r\n* Be granted access to submit, edit, and check out content from the Resonator Repo\r\n\r\nIf you've never used GitHub before, and decided to give it a Google-ing, you likely saw a fair bit of discussion about Git, command line, and specialized syntax. **Don't worry about it.** For our purposes, you won't ever have to write any command codes - unless you want to. The following sections outline the necessary process - and honestly, it's no different than posting a batch of photos to Facebook.\r\n\r\n######<a id=\"account\"></a>Creating a GitHub Account ######\r\n\r\n######<a id=\"client\"></a>Downloading and Installing the GitHub Client ######\r\n\r\n######<a id=\"system\"></a>Obtaining Access to Resonator's System ######\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"roles\"></a>Roles ###\r\n\r\n######<a id=\"columnist\"></a>Columnist #######\r\n\r\nAs a columnist, you play a starring role in Resonator. \r\n\r\nOf course, there is that SpiderMan caveat about power and responsibility. Resonator relies on columnists for recurring content, both on the website and in the magazine proper. Because of this, you're ability to work with our GitHub system needs to be a bit more in-depth than that of the casual contributor. All of your draft submissions will need to be pushed to our Columnist repo so that we can maintain solid version control practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"style_guide\"></a>The Resonator Style Guide ###\r\n\r\n######<a id=\"formatting\"></a>Formatting Your Submission #######\r\n\r\n######<a id=\"metadata\"></a>Metadata #######\r\n\r\n######<a id=\"copyright\"></a>Copyright #######\r\n\r\n######<a id=\"credit\"></a>Credit #######","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
